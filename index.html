    <h2>The Value of Urban Nature Spaces</h2>
    <p><time datetime="2025-06-08">June 8, 2025</time> by <span class="author">Evan McNulty</span></p>

    <p>Urban green spaces are more than just aesthetic additions to a city. They serve as important habitats, provide mental health benefits, and improve air quality. In my experience volunteering in conservation, I’ve seen how transforming even a small vacant lot into a native plant garden can revitalize a community and support pollinators. Cities like Portland and Minneapolis are investing heavily in green infrastructure, creating more walkable and livable neighborhoods.</p>

    <h2>Lessons From Four Years at Stiles Pond Camp</h2>

    <p>Stiles Pond Day Camp taught me so much—resilience, leadership, patience. Whether it was leading nature hikes or helping kids conquer their fear of the water, I learned the importance of presence and empathy. These experiences made me appreciate the power of outdoor education in shaping confidence and curiosity in kids. Plus, who doesn’t love a lakeside sunset and s'mores?</p>
