  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hey, I’m Evan McNulty. I’m a student at Michigan State University studying Fisheries and Wildlife with minors in Marine Ecosystem Management and Business. I’ve always been into the outdoors and care a lot about the way people interact with nature, especially when it comes to conservation and restoration.</p>

  <p>This summer I’m working as a restoration intern in Florida, helping plant eelgrass, scrub cages in rivers, and keep track of how the habitats are recovering. I’ve also worked as a lifeguard, at a summer camp, and even as a window cleaner in some pretty rough weather. Each of those jobs has taught me something different and helped me figure out what I enjoy and care about.</p>

  <h3>Things I’m Into</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Anything involving water like lakes, rivers, and diving</li>
    <li>Wildlife conservation and restoration projects</li>
    <li>Being outside and doing hands-on fieldwork</li>
    <li>Exploring new places and working with cool people</li>
  </ul>
